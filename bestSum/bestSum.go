				bestSum

	>	Write a function `bestSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a targetSum and an array of number as arguments.
	>	The function should return an array containing the shortest combination of numbers that add up to exactly the targetSum.
	>	If there is no combination that adds up to the targetSum, then return nil.
	>	If there is a tie for the shortest combination, you may return any one of the shortest.
	>	You may use an element of the array as many times as needed.
	>	You may assume that all input numbers are nonnegative.
